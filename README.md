## Explanation of terms used in BlockChain
  ### 1. Azure 

      Azure is a public cloud computing platform—with solutions including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) that can be used for services such as analytics, virtual computing, storage, networking, and much more.

  ### 2. Cloud  
      Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

  ### 3. Azure blob storage
      Azure Blob Storage helps you create data lakes for your analytics needs, and provides storage to build powerful cloud-native and mobile apps.

  ### 4. Azure SDK
      Programmatically manage and interact with Azure services.

      The Azure SDKs are collections of libraries built to make it easier to use Azure services from your language of choice. 
      These libraries are designed to be consistent, approachable, diagnosable, dependable and idiomatic
       
  ### 5. Azure Storage connection strings
      A connection string includes the authorization information required for your application to access data in an Azure Storage account at runtime using Shared Key authorization. You can configure connection strings to:

      Connect to the Azurite storage emulator.
      Access a storage account in Azure.
      Access specified resources in Azure via a shared access signature (SAS).
    
  ### 6. .env file in Node.js
      .env files provide a popular solution for defining environment variables, particularly in Node.js. 

  ### 7. Resource Group
      Nonce, short for “number used once”, is a random number that can only be used one time. 
      Nonces are generated for a specific use, most often to modify the result of a function in a cryptographic communication. 
      Discovering the next block is done by finding the right nonce, 
      that when combined with the previous block hash, provides a lower hash value than the target.  
      This specific nonce that satisfies the mining requirement of the next block is called the “Golden Nonce”.
